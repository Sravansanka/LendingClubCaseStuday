# Lending Club Case Study

### Problem Statement
A finance organization provides different loans to urban customers, faces a critical challenge in managing its loan approval process. When evaluating loan applications, the company must make informed decisions to minimize financial losses, which are primarily caused by lending to "risky" applicants.

Credit Losses occur when borrowers fail to repay their loans or default. In simple terms, borrowers labeled as "Charged-Off" are responsible for the largest financial losses to the company.

Goal of this analysis is to help LendingClub mitigate these credit losses. This challenge arises from two key scenarios:
Identifying applicants who are likely to repay their loans is crucial, as they can generate profits for the company through interest payments. Rejecting such applicants would lead to a loss of potential business.
Approving loans for applicants who are unlikely to repay and are at risk of default can result in substantial financial losses for the company.

The objective of this case study is to identify high-risk applicants who are likely to default, enabling the company to reduce credit losses. This will be achieved through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the provided dataset.

Ultimately, the company aims to understand the key drivers or predictive variables behind loan defaults—those factors that strongly indicate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting. By gaining insights into these drivers, the company can better assess its portfolio and evaluate risks more effectively.




### Objectives

The objective is to pinpoint applicants at risk of defaulting on loans, enabling a reduction in credit losses. This case study aims to achieve this goal through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the provided [dataset](./loan.csv).

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

The primary objective of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in mitigating credit losses. This challenge arises from two potential scenarios:

1. Identifying applicants likely to repay their loans is crucial, as they can generate profits for the company through interest payments. Rejecting such applicants would result in a loss of potential business.
2. On the other hand, approving loans for applicants not likely to repay and at risk of default can lead to substantial financial losses for the company.

## Conclusions

**Implement Stricter Criteria for Grades B, C, and D:  **
  - Apply stricter risk assessment and underwriting criteria for applicants falling into Grades B, C, and D to minimize default risks.

**Focus on Subgrades B3, B4, and B5:  **
  - Pay special attention to applicants with Subgrades B3, B4, and B5.  
  - Consider additional risk mitigation measures, such as offering lower loan amounts for these subgrades to reduce default rates.

**Evaluate and Limit 60-Month Loans: ** 
  - Evaluate the risk associated with 60-month loans.  
  - Consider limiting the maximum term or adjusting interest rates for longer-term loans to decrease the likelihood of defaults.

**Comprehensive Credit Scoring System: ** 
  - Develop a comprehensive credit scoring system that incorporates various risk-related attributes.  
  - Relying on experience alone might not be sufficient to gauge creditworthiness.

**Capitalizing on Market Growth:  **
  - Capitalize on the market's growth trend observed from 2007 to 2011 by maintaining a competitive edge in the industry.  
  - Ensure robust risk management practices to safeguard against increasing risks.

**Anticipate Peak Periods:  **
  - Anticipate increased loan applications during peak periods such as December and Q4.  
  - Ensure efficient processing to meet customer demands during these busy seasons.

**Careful Evaluation for Debt Consolidation Loans:  **
  - Carefully evaluate applicants seeking debt consolidation loans.  
  - Consider potential interest rate adjustments or offering financial counseling services to manage the associated risks
  
 **Consider Housing Stability:  **
  - Take housing status into account during the underwriting process.  
  - Assess housing stability and its impact on the applicant's ability to repay the loan.

**Review Verification Process:  **
  - Review the verification process to ensure effective assessment of applicant creditworthiness.  
  - Consider improvements or adjustments based on the review findings.

**Monitor & Adjust for Regional Risk Trends:  **
  - Monitor regional risk trends, especially in states like California, Florida, and New York.  
  - Adjust lending strategies or rates accordingly in high-risk regions.

**Thorough Assessment for High Loan Amounts:  **
  - Conduct more thorough assessments for loan amounts of $15,000 or higher.  
  - Consider capping loan amounts for higher-risk applicants to mitigate potential defaults.

**Adjust Interest Rates Based on DTI Ratios:  **
  - Review the interest rate determination process and consider adjusting rates based on Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios.  
  - Align rates with the borrower’s ability to repay.

**Consider Income Levels for Affordability:  **
  - Consider offering financial education resources and set maximum loan amounts based on annual incomes below $40,000.  
  - Ensure loan affordability for borrowers.
